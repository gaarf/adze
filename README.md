adze
====

An adze is an ancient type of edge tool dating back to the stone age. Adzes are used for smoothing or carving wood in hand woodworking, similar to an axe but with the head mounted perpendicular to the handle. Modern adzes are made from steel with wooden handles, and enjoy limited use: occasionally in semi-industrial areas, but particularly by 'revivalists' such as those at the Colonial Williamsburg cultural center in Virginia, USA. It remains in use for some specialist crafts, for example by coopers.
